Suppose you are given a few batches of data (batch_size is 4), which may have one or more inputs and only one label per sample. Each data sample is in one line with each part started with a special token like [label] and the batches are separated by one extra blank line.
When given the data, you should first output how many batches you receive in the first line by a SINGLE number. Then, as to each batch, you are asked to describe which task is it. Each batch should ONLY have one line of description. Any other output is FORBIDDEN.

For example:
My input is:
[sentence] They drank the pub dry. [label] acceptable
[sentence] They drank the pub. [label] unacceptable
[sentence] The professor talked us into a stupor. [label] acceptable
[sentence] The professor talked us. [label] unacceptable

[sentence] hide new secretions from the parental units [label] negative
[sentence] contains no wit , only labored gags [label] negative
[sentence] that loves its characters and communicates something rather beautiful about human nature [label] positive
[sentence] remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout [label] negative

Since there are 2 batches, you should first output "2" in the first line. Then, you should describe these two batches as instructed above use ONLY 2 lines. As a result, one possible answer could be:
2
This is a task of text classification to recognize whether the input sentence is semantically acceptable.
This is a task of text classification to classify the sentiment of the given sentence to positive or negative.

Next, I will give you a few batches, act just as I instruct above.
